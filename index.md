## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hello! I am Anmol Rattan Singh Sandhu a sophomore studying Engineering with Computing at the <a href="https://www.olin.edu">Olin College of Engineering</a>. I'm an aspiring Computer Scientist with a passion to use platforms for solving social and environmental problems.

Below are all the projects I have worked on recently.

## Portfolio
- [Whack-A-Mole](https://whackamole.yammer.me), arcade game replica. Built using pneumatic solenoids controlled by an **Arduino** connected to a **Raspberry Pi** to a **React.js** web-app display inside a wooden arcade machine.
- [Image matching algorithms benchmarking](https://github.com/occamLab/MatchingBenchmarking), on data collected from co-designers of the [Clew app](http://www.clewapp.org). Benchmarks popular **OpenCV** algorithms against the **neural network** [SuperGlue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763) using **Lidar** data as ground truth.
- [Huffman Encoding](https://github.com/VedaantKuchhal/Huffman), implementation in **GoLang**.
- [Hole-in-the-camera](https://olincollege.github.io/hole-in-the-camera/) - Digital version of the game show ["Hole in the Wall"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_the_Wall_(American_game_show)) implemented using **OpenCV**, **PyGame**, and **OpenPose**.
- [InstaMile](https://sites.google.com/view/instamile/home?authuser=0) - Pedometer built using **React-Native** to calculate a **Fast-Fourier transform** on phone accelerometer data to analyze step data.
- [2D RPG exploration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l2sjOOWT9BFI3cXTwW9fSGwUXtVfXrzv/view?usp=share_link) game being built using **Unity** to teach young kids about gender identities in collaboration with the non-profit Out Maine.
