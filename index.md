## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hello! I am Anmol Rattan Singh Sandhu a sophomore studying Engineering with Computing at the <a href="https://www.olin.edu">Olin College of Engineering</a>. I'm an aspiring Computer Scientist with a passion to use platforms for solving social and environmental problems.

Below are all the projects I have worked on recently.

## Portfolio
- [Whack-A-Mole](https://whackamole.yammer.me), arcade game replica. Built using pneumatic solenoids controlled by an Arduino connected to a Raspberry Pi to a React web-app display inside a wooden arcade machine.
- [Image matching algorithms benchmarking](https://github.com/occamLab/MatchingBenchmarking), image algorithm benchmarking on data collected from co-designers of the [Clew app](http://www.clewapp.org). Benchmarks popular OpenCV algorithms against the neural network [SuperGlue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763).
- [Huffman Encoding](https://github.com/VedaantKuchhal/Huffman), implementation in GoLang.
- [Hole-in-the-camera](https://github.com/olincollege/hole-in-the-camera) - Digital version of the game show ["Hole in the Wall"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_the_Wall_(American_game_show)) implemented using OpenCV, pygame, and OpenPose.
- [InstaMile](https://caitlincoffey.com/finalprojectml/) - Pedometer built using React-Native to calculate a Fast-Fourier transform on phone accelerometer data to analyze step data.
- [2D RPG exploration](https://github.com/lilibaker/outmaine/) game being built using Unity to teach young kids about gender identities in collaboration with the non-profit Out Maine.
