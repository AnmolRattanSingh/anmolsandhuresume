## Portfolio

- [image-segmentation](https://github.com/MarcEftimie/image-segmentation/tree/main) - utilizes **graph cut algorithms** and **network flows** to separate images into distinct segments. Built in **Python** with **NetworkX** and **OpenCV**.
- [Robot_localization_cpp](https://github.com/richardli03/robot_localization_cpp) - implementation of a particle filter algorithm for localizing a robot in a known map using **Lidar** data. Built in **ROS** and **C++**.
- [Multiagent Search and Rescue](https://sites.google.com/view/comprobo23-search-and-rescue/home) - a centralized multiagent system designed to efficiently search a space to find a target. Built in **ROS** and **Python**.
- [CNN-MNIST](https://github.com/mtong1/CNN-MNIST) - a **Python** implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network** to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Implemented using only **NumPy**.
- [Clipboard-Transformer](https://github.com/olincollege/clipboard-transformer) - a simple tool to transform text in your clipboard. Implemented in **C++**.
- [C-Web-Server](https://github.com/olincollege/C-web-server) - a simple **HTTP** web server written in **c** that serves files from a path specified by the user in the URL.
- [Simulated Annealing Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/AnmolRattanSingh/sudoku-solver) - a **Python** implementation of the [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.
- [RSA Encryption deep dive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ALYc75TGjUVUBroIIlnw8Xg43m9ouk4j/view?usp=share_link) - analysis of the [RSA encryption algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) with a focus on its theoretical limitations such as **quantum computing**. This paper was written for my **advanced algorithms** class.
- [Branch and bound deep dive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfjDEiEAgP5eJa9nEzbPKYQlnItBhuQb/view?usp=sharing) - an in-depth analysis of the [branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound#Optimization_Example) optimization algorithm with a focus on its medical applications and theoretical limitations such as **parallelization**. This paper was written for my **advanced algorithms** class.
- [Whack-A-Mole](https://whackamole.yammer.me), arcade game replica. Built using pneumatic solenoids controlled by an **Arduino** connected to a **Raspberry Pi** to a **React.js** web-app display inside a wooden arcade machine.
- [Hole-in-the-camera](https://olincollege.github.io/hole-in-the-camera/) - Digital version of the game show ["Hole in the Wall"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_the_Wall_(American_game_show)) implemented using **OpenCV**, **PyGame**, and **OpenPose**.
- [Image matching algorithms benchmarking](https://github.com/occamLab/MatchingBenchmarking), on data collected from co-designers of the [Clew app](http://www.clewapp.org). Benchmarks popular **OpenCV** algorithms against the **neural network** [SuperGlue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763) using **Lidar** data as ground truth.
- [Huffman Encoding](https://github.com/VedaantKuchhal/Huffman), a compression algorithm implemented in **GoLang**.
