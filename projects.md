## Portfolio

More projects I have worked on:

- [Robot_localization_cpp](https://github.com/richardli03/robot_localization_cpp) - implementation of a particle filter algorithm for localizing a robot in a known map using **Lidar** data. Built in **ROS** and **C++**.
- [Multiagent Search and Rescue](https://sites.google.com/view/comprobo23-search-and-rescue/home) - a centralized multiagent system designed to efficiently search a space to find a target. Built in **ROS** and **Python**.
- [RSA Encryption deep dive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ALYc75TGjUVUBroIIlnw8Xg43m9ouk4j/view?usp=share_link) - analysis of the [RSA encryption algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) with a focus on its theoretical limitations such as **quantum computing**. This paper was written for my **advanced algorithms** class.
- [Branch and bound deep dive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfjDEiEAgP5eJa9nEzbPKYQlnItBhuQb/view?usp=sharing) - an in-depth analysis of the [branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound#Optimization_Example) optimization algorithm with a focus on its medical applications and theoretical limitations such as **parallelization**. This paper was written for my **advanced algorithms** class.
- [Whack-A-Mole](https://whackamole.yammer.me), arcade game replica. Built using pneumatic solenoids controlled by an **Arduino** connected to a **Raspberry Pi** to a **React.js** web-app display inside a wooden arcade machine.
- [Image matching algorithms benchmarking](https://github.com/occamLab/MatchingBenchmarking), on data collected from co-designers of the [Clew app](http://www.clewapp.org). Benchmarks popular **OpenCV** algorithms against the **neural network** [SuperGlue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763) using **Lidar** data as ground truth.
- [Huffman Encoding](https://github.com/VedaantKuchhal/Huffman), a compression algorithm implemented in **GoLang**.
- [InstaMile](https://sites.google.com/view/instamile/home?authuser=0) - Pedometer built using **React-Native** to calculate a **Fast-Fourier transform** on phone accelerometer data to analyze step data.
